diff files ignoring white space
-w effectively removes all whitespace from the lines before comparing, so ab and a b are considered identical. 
I prefer -b because it ignores whitespace changes, meaning that ab and a b are considered different but a b and a + multiple spaces + b (sorry, mini-Markdown wouldn't allow multiple spaces in code!) are considered the same.



a recursive directory diff but only for a specific file type
the exclude option
diff /destination/dir/1 /destination/dir/2 -r -x *.xml

specify -x more than once.
diff -x '*.foo' -x '*.bar' -x '*.baz' /destination/dir/1 /destination/dir/2

?
diff -qr -x '*.ts' rxjs_in_x_lessons-main/src/ rxjs_in_x_lessons-dev/demo6/src
diff -qr -x *.ts rxjs_in_x_lessons-main/src rxjs_in_x_lessons-dev/demo6/src

diff -r -x *.ts rxjs_in_x_lessons-main/src rxjs_in_x_lessons-dev/demo6/src
diff -r -x "*.ts" rxjs_in_x_lessons-main/src rxjs_in_x_lessons-dev/demo6/src

Only include files that match a given pattern in a recursive diff
a recursive diff of the files in two directories (a and b):

$ diff -r a b

but only look at files whose name matches a given pattern. For example, using the same syntax available in the find command, this would look like:

$ diff -r a b -name "*crazy*"

which would show diffs between files with the same name and path in a and b, which have "crazy" in their name.

Effectively, I'm looking for the opposite of the --exclude option which is available in diff.



You can use find to get a list of files that don't match the pattern, and then "exclude" all those files:

find a b -type f ! -name 'crazy' -printf '%f\n' | diff -r a b -X -

The -X - will make diff read the patterns from stdin and exclude anything that matches. This should work provided your files don't have funny chars like * or ? in their names. The only downside is that your diff won't include the find command, so the listed diff command is not that useful.

Since only non-GNU find doesn't have -printf, sed could be used as an alternative:

find a b -type f ! -name '*crazy*' -print | sed -e 's|.*/||' | diff -X - -r a b
