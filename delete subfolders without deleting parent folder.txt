delete subfolders without deleting parent folder

rm -rf /config/filegroups/*



If you want to delete only directories (and symlinks to directories), leaving any files in /config/filegroups untouched, you can use a trailing slash:

rm -rf /config/filegroups/*/



If you want to delete directories with names beginning with a . as well, assuming you have a fairly recent bash, you should use the dotglob shell option:

shopt -s dotglob
rm -rf /config/filegroups/*/
shopt -u dotglob



find /config/filegroups/ -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;




This will delete all files and directories under /config/filegroups including "hidden" files and directories (names starting with .).

find /config/filegroups -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 | xargs rm -rf



If the file or directory names contain spaces you have to do it like this:

find /config/filegroups -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf



Bonus: you can first check what is going to be deleted like this:

find /config/filegroups -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1



If you want to keep certain files or directories you can do it like this:

find /config/filegroups -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -not -name "keep"

=

cd C:/angulartraining_alcfeoh-main
find . -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 | xargs rm -rf
