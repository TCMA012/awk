Then best I can tell you'd just 
change strBeg-1 to strBeg and 
strBeg+strLen to strBeg+strLen-1 in 
$0 = substr($0,1,strBeg-1) map[string] substr($0,strBeg+strLen)
 to consume those extra "s. If that's not exactly right then just adjust those numbers by 1 a couple of times til it is.
 
I changed strBeg-1 to strBeg and 
strBeg+strLen to strBeg+strLen-1 in 
$0 = substr($0,1,strBeg-1) map[string] substr($0,strBeg+strLen)
as per your comments, but that's not exactly right.
Then I changed strBeg-1 to strBeg+1 and 
strBeg+strLen to strBeg+strLen-1, but that's not exactly right.
