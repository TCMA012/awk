extract-file-basename-without-path-and-extension-in-bash
You don't have to call the external basename command. Instead, you could use the following commands:

$ s=/the/path/foo.txt
$ echo "${s##*/}"
foo.txt

$ s=${s##*/}
$ echo "${s%.txt}"
foo
$ echo "${s%.*}"


f=Lab11.zip
echo "${f%.*}"
Lab11
