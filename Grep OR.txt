Grep OR Using \|
If you use the grep command without any option, you need to use \| to separate multiple patterns for the or condition.

grep 'pattern1\|pattern2' filename



Grep OR Using -E
grep -E option is for extended regexp. If you use the grep command with -E option, you just need to use | to separate multiple patterns for the or condition.

grep -E 'pattern1|pattern2' filename



Grep AND using -E ‘pattern1.*pattern2’
There is no AND operator in grep. But, you can simulate AND using grep -E option.

grep -E 'pattern1.*pattern2' filename
grep -E 'pattern1.*pattern2|pattern2.*pattern1' filename



Grep NOT using grep -v
Using grep -v you can simulate the NOT conditions. -v option is for invert match. i.e It matches all the lines except the given pattern.

grep -v 'pattern1' filename
