?: is for non capturing group
?= is for positive look ahead
?! is for negative look ahead
?<= is for positive look behind
?<! is for negative look behind



The difference between ?= and ?! is that the former requires the given expression to match and the latter requires it to not match. For example a(?=b) will match the "a" in "ab", but not the "a" in "ac". Whereas a(?!b) will match the "a" in "ac", but not the "a" in "ab".

The difference between ?: and ?= is that ?= excludes the expression from the entire match while ?: just doesn't create a capturing group. So for example a(?:b) will match the "ab" in "abc", while a(?=b) will only match the "a" in "abc". a(b) would match the "ab" in "abc" and create a capture containing the "b".



()   capturing group - the regex inside the parenthesis must be matched and the match create a capturing group
(?:) non-capturing group - the regex inside the parenthesis must be matched but does not create the capturing group
